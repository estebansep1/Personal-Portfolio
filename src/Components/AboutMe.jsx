              Hello, I'm Esteban, and I have recently graduated from San Diego
              State's Software Development Bootcamp. I'm passionate about
              coding, dedicated to learning, and growing in the world of
              software development.

            As a junior developer my skills expand well into both front-end and back-end technologies. 
            Alongside deepening my expertise in software engineering, I'm embarking on an exciting journey into robotics and gadgets, starting with Arduino projects. 
            My enthusiasm for turning these ideas into reality is sky-high. I'm right at the starting line, ready to explore how coding can bring innovative projects to life.
